#### Creating your app

Create your app with `heroku create [name]`

You can check that this was successful by running `heroku apps` to view a list of your apps


#### Adding postgres

Add postgresql (hobby dev) to your app at `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/[APP NAME HERE]/resources`

Check that pg has been added by running `heroku addons` to ensure the postgresql db is on your app


### Deploying!

I have created several npm scripts that will be useful for deploying your app to heroku easily.

`npm run h:deploy` will push your local master branch to your heroku app

`npm run h:migrate` will run your knex migrations on your deployed heroku app

`npm run h:seed` will run your seeds on your deployed app

If ever you need to rollback, you can also just use `npm run h:rollback`


## Ta-Da!
Your app should be deployed!
